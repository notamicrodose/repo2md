# repo2md

repo2md is a web app built with python, html, css and vanilla js that allows users to upload github repos (folders) and combine them into a single Markdown file to make it easier to share code with LLMs. Project is developed by Gabriel Kripalani (gabriel@agenticc.com)

## Utility
The web ui lets you combine a repository into a single properly formatted .md file. It automatically excludes folders such as `node_modules`, `__pycache__` and a lot of file extensions unrelated to the sourcecode. You also have the option to manually exclude specific directories or files.

## Features

- Drag and drop file uploader
- Select/deselect folders and files before combining files
- Preview the generated markdown file before downloading
- Syntax highlighting
- Excludes unwanted directories and file types (node_modules, .git, etc.)
- Includes a file tree of the repo in the output file

## Roadmap

- Integration with GitHub
- API access
- Refactoring
